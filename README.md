# ESP32 CAM setup
just some basic yaml code to get an esp32 cam running on Home Assistant (via EspHome),
it will create entities for the cam feed and flashlight on your Dashboard

Setup I used:
- use default esp32 model when creating espCam in Home Assistant
- copy yaml. code
- change password/ name
- installation: manual download, open espHome web and connect + install
- add entities to dashboard
